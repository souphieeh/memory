    <h1>Celebrity memory game</h1>
    <p>We, Sophie M, Sophie H, Olivia, and Cilia decided to create a fun, modern memory game for you to enjoy. We assume that all of you have played memory before, and we thought this well-known childhood game could bring you back in time. You can find the rules and instructions down below.
    </br>
    <h3>Components on computer:</h3>
    <li> Field of 28 squares </li>
    <li> 14 pictures of celebrities </li>
    <h3>Object of the game:</h3>
    Find the most pairs of matching pictures of celebrities. 
    <h3> Rules of the game:</h3>
    The eldest gets to go first because our game is ☼different☼
    <h3>Instructions on how to play:</h3>
    <li>On your screen you see a field of squares. The eldest player goes first. </li>
    <li>Players take turns to click on two squares to see if they have a match. </li>
    <li>If the pictures that appear are a match the player can take another go. </li>
    <li>If the pictures clicked aren’t of the same celebrity, it’s the next person’s go. </li>
    <li>Try to remember which celebrity picture is where. </li>
    <li>game continues until all pictures have been matched.</li>
    <li>Make sure to keep count of how many pairs you got. </li>
    <li>The player with the most pairs of matching pictures wins.</li>
</br>
    Solo Play: Is a good practice for developing concentration and memory skills. 
    <li>Count the number of turns it takes you to match them al </li>
    <li>Try to improve with each game you play.</li>
    <h3>Documentation:</h3>
    <li>Downloaded visual studio code</li>
    <li>Decided to try coding a memory game with celebrity pictures</li>
    <li>Created a repository </li>
    <li>Chose the celebrity pictures and cropped them into the right size</li>
    <li>Searched YouTube videos or websites that explain what we have to do</li>
    <li>Found a YouTube video and started to copy code</li>
    <li>Mr. De Capitani informed us that it would not be wise to use said code as
    </br>
    it was too complicated and helped us develop a new and improved code</li>
    <li>The code worked!</li>
    <li>Added a little bit of spice to the game: made it more interesting (added the pictures)</li>
    <li>Wrote website for documentation </li>
